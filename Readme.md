# SING
> Subgraph search In Non-homogeneous Graphs

### Description:
SING implements a novel indexing system able to cope with large graphs. The method uses the notion of feature, which can be a small subgraph, subtree or path. Each graph in the database is annotated with the set of all its features. The key point is to make use of
feature locality information. This idea is used to both improve the filtering performance and speed up the subgraph isomorphism task.
